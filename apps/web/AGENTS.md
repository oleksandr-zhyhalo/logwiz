# apps/web — Agent Guide

## About

Log viewer UI served by the product. SvelteKit with `@sveltejs/adapter-static`, a client-rendered SPA (`index.html` fallback, no SSR or prerendering) with no server runtime. The Hono backend in `apps/api` is the only backend; `apps/web` talks to it over HTTP.

For repo-wide rules (Bun, Prettier, TS strict, no tests), see the root `AGENTS.md`. For Svelte 5 patterns and the Svelte MCP server, see [Svelte 5 Patterns](#svelte-5-patterns) below.

## Stack

- SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5
- `@sveltejs/adapter-static`
- Tailwind v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite`
- DaisyUI 5 (custom `rootprint` theme — see Design System below)
- Better Auth client + Hono RPC client
- Valibot for client-side validation (schemas re-exported from `api/schemas`)

## Run, Build, Check

```bash
bun --filter web dev              # vite dev (proxies /api to apps/api)
bun --filter web build            # static build
bun --filter web preview          # preview the built SPA
bun --filter web check            # svelte-kit sync && svelte-check
bun --filter web lint             # oxlint
```

## Data Loading

`apps/web` is an SPA built with `adapter-static`. There is no server runtime — `apps/api` is the only backend.

- All data loading lives in `+page.ts` / `+layout.ts`.
- Do **not** add `+page.server.ts` or `hooks.server.ts` — `adapter-static` has no server.
- Auth: `authClient` from `$lib/auth-client`.
- API: `api` from `$lib/api/client` (typed Hono RPC).
- Cookies are same-origin in both dev (Vite proxy → api) and prod (api serves the SPA).

### Error handling

Loaders (`+page.ts` / `+layout.ts`) follow one of three conventions, chosen by intent:

- **Bubble (default):** let the error propagate to the root `+error.svelte`. Use for generic failures with no special handling.
- **`error(status, msg)`:** call it, don't `throw` it (SvelteKit 2 throws internally). Use only to surface a _meaningful_ HTTP status/message (e.g. mapping a typed `IndexApiError` 404 to "Index not found"). See `routes/(app)/settings/(admin)/indexes/[indexId]/+page.ts`.
- **Return a discriminated result** (e.g. `{ error: 'not_found' | 'forbidden' | 'unknown' }`): use only when the page renders its own inline error UI instead of the global error page. See `routes/(app)/s/[code]/+page.ts`.

Do not add `try/catch` to a loader unless it implements one of the two non-default conventions for a deliberate reason.

## Svelte 5 Patterns

- Use runes: `$props`, `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$bindable`.
- `<script lang="ts">` everywhere.
- Use `{@attach ...}`, not `use:`, for your own DOM behaviour. `use:` is reserved for third-party actions that ship no attachment (currently only `svelte-dnd-action`). Shared attachments go in `$lib/attachments/`; one-offs stay local to the component.
- Attachments are fully reactive — `{@attach foo(bar)}` tears down and re-runs whenever `bar` changes. When the value changes often (a keystroke) or the caller passes a fresh closure each render (a virtualised row), take a **getter** and read it inside the attachment instead: `{@attach foo(() => bar)}`. See `$lib/attachments/row-activate.ts`.
- For deeper Svelte 5 / SvelteKit guidance, use the Svelte MCP server: call `list-sections` first, then `get-documentation` for every section whose `use_cases` match the task.

## Design System

### Theme

A single DaisyUI 5 custom theme named `rootprint` is the source of truth. It is declared in `src/app.css` via `@plugin "daisyui/theme"` and applied through `data-theme="rootprint"` in `src/app.html`. The theme is light, flat, and uses a single brand-green accent.

Do not introduce a second theme or add a `data-theme` override elsewhere. If you need a dark surface, use `base-content` or `neutral`; don't fork the theme.

### Color Roles

Use semantic DaisyUI classes (`bg-base-100`, `text-base-content`, `btn-primary`, …); never the raw hex values. The current mapping:

| Role           | Use for                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `base-100`     | App canvas (white)                                     |
| `base-200`     | Elevated panels, cards, the auth card                  |
| `base-300`     | Field backgrounds, dividers                            |
| `base-content` | Default text                                           |
| `primary`      | Brand-green action — primary buttons, focal highlights |
| `secondary`    | Dark-green text on green, or inverted accent contexts  |
| `accent`       | Blue informational accent (used sparingly)             |
| `neutral`      | Strong neutral surface (e.g. inverted dark button)     |
| `info`         | Code-identifier blue                                   |
| `success`      | Confirmation                                           |
| `warning`      | Caution                                                |
| `error`        | Field/form errors                                      |
| `muted`        | Secondary labels and supporting text on light surfaces |
| `subtle`       | Tertiary metadata on light surfaces, not disabled text |
| `info-ink`     | Blue text and chart strokes on light surfaces          |
| `warning-ink`  | Warning text and chart strokes on light surfaces       |

The brand-green is the visual signature. Use it for one primary CTA per surface, not for decoration. `info`, `accent`, and `warning` are fills — use the `-ink` variants for text on light surfaces and the `--chart-N` ramp for chart strokes.

### Typography

- Sans: **Geist**. Mono: **Geist Mono**. Self-hosted variable woff2 under `static/fonts/`, loaded via `@font-face` in `app.css`.
- Body is `0.875rem / 1.5rem` (14px / 24px), small and data-dense by default.
- Headings are **regular weight (400)** with **tight tracking** at large sizes. Do not use `font-bold` on headings. The size carries the hierarchy, not the weight. The base layer in `app.css` already sets `font-weight: 400` and `letter-spacing: -0.02em` on `h1–h4`; don't override it.
- Tokens `text-display`, `text-h1`, `text-h2`, `text-h3` are available via Tailwind v4's `@theme` for arbitrary headings outside the HTML hierarchy.
- Use `text-ui` (13px / 20px) for compact controls, `text-caption` (12px / 16px) for metadata, and `.section-label` (12px / 18px, medium) for workspace section and table labels. Standard `text-sm` remains appropriate for navigation, forms, and body copy.
- Mono text is for code, queries, IDs, timestamps, and log payloads — sans everywhere else. Use `tabular-nums` for aligned numbers rather than making their labels monospace.

### Material — Flat

- No shadows on in-page surfaces (cards, panels, tables, forms). Elevation is implied by `base-200` surfaces and `border-line` hairlines, not by drop shadow. One exception: floating overlays **without a backdrop dim** (chart tooltips, popovers, the log drawer) may carry a shadow to separate from the content beneath. Modals get a dimmed backdrop and must stay `shadow-none` (see `ui/Modal`).
- Small radii: `rounded` and `rounded-box` (4px) for fields, controls, and panels. Avoid `rounded-xl`/`rounded-2xl`/`rounded-full` except for genuine pill/avatar shapes.
- `--depth: 0` and `--noise: 0` are set on the theme. Don't override them.

### Reusable Component Classes

Defined in `src/app.css` under `@layer components`:

- `.eyebrow` — uppercase sans micro-label used **above** a page heading. Reserve it for page introductions, not chart titles or result metadata.
- `.section-label` — sentence-case sans label for workspace sections, chart titles, and table headings.
- `.settings-page` — centered settings content with padding based on the named `settings` container width. Use it instead of fixed `px-12 py-12` page shells.

Hairlines are not a class but a color token: `--color-line` (1px-intent line at 10% of `base-content`, defined in `app.css` under `@theme inline`). It generates `border-line`, `border-b-line`, `divide-line`, etc. Use it to frame cards, panels, dividers on the light canvas — it replaces `shadow-*` for elevation. Compose with Tailwind utilities, e.g. `class="border-line rounded-box border p-8"`.

### Forms

- For inputs with adornments use DaisyUI 5's `<label class="input">` floating-label pattern (`label` span + bare `<input>` child). Do not use ad-hoc button-on-input layouts that produce separate floating hover shapes.
- Field-level errors render as **micro-text** under the input (`class="text-error text-xs"`, no mono — `ui/Field` is the contract), not inside an alert chip.
- Form-level errors render as a top-of-card `alert alert-error` chip.
- The default 2px DaisyUI focus ring on `.input`/`.select`/`.textarea` is overridden in `app.css` to a 1px `base-content` border-color shift. Same footprint, no visual jump — keep it that way and don't add `focus:ring-*` utilities on form controls.

### Page Composition

Recurring patterns to reach for before inventing new ones:

- **Eyebrow + Heading + Body** — `<p class="eyebrow">…</p>` then `<h1 class="text-3xl tracking-tight">…</h1>` then body. This is the default page-header shape.
- **Hairline panel** — `<div class="border-line rounded-box border p-8">…</div>` on `base-200` for any framed content. The auth card and the home session panel both use this.
- **Metadata grid** — use sentence-case `<dt class="text-muted text-caption">` labels and sans values, reserving `<dd class="font-mono text-sm">` for IDs, timestamps, and code.
- The app is desktop-only. Below `md` the root layout renders a desktop-size notice instead of route content.

### What Not to Do

- Don't add `shadow-xl` (or any shadow) to cards or other in-page surfaces — shadows are reserved for undimmed floating overlays (see Material).
- Don't use `font-bold` on headings — the regular weight at large size is intentional.
- Don't hard-code hex values in Svelte files; use DaisyUI semantic classes.
- Don't add `focus:ring-*` to form controls — the global `.input` focus state is already defined.
- Don't introduce a new theme or a per-component `data-theme` override.
- Don't reintroduce DaisyUI's `card`/`card-body` for shells — they pull a different radius and padding scale. Use the `border-line + rounded-box + border + p-8` recipe.

## Error Handling

- SvelteKit `+error.svelte` at the root catches uncaught route errors. It already uses the eyebrow/heading pattern; match it if you add nested error boundaries.
- API errors: parse `ApiErrorBody` from `api/types` and surface `error.message` (and `details[].path` for field-level mapping). See `routes/auth/setup-admin/+page.svelte` for the canonical flow.
- Validate inputs with the Valibot schemas re-exported from `api/schemas` so client and server agree on shape.

## Tests

No tests. Manual visual review via `bun --filter web dev` or `bun --filter web preview`.

## Conventions

- TS strict (extends `tsconfig.base.json`).
- Single quotes, tabs, no trailing commas (Prettier).
- `prettier-plugin-svelte` + `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` normalize Svelte files and class-attribute order — let them.
- Use SvelteKit aliases (`$lib`, `$app`, `$env`) over deep relative paths.
- Cross-workspace types: `import type { ... } from 'api/types'`. Schemas: `import { ... } from 'api/schemas'`.
- Component callback props are camelCase (`onSave`, `onToggleSort`); lowercase only when the prop mirrors a native DOM event on an element the component wraps (`Modal`'s `onclose`/`oncancel`).
- `.svelte.ts` modules are kebab-case (`metrics-poller.svelte.ts`), like all other `.ts` files.
