# Changelog

All notable changes to Rootprint are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.3] - 2026-09-10

### ⚠️ Breaking

- `GET /api/indexes/{indexId}/fields` now requires `startTs` and `endTs` in epoch seconds.

### Added

- Range-scoped discovery of dynamic and nested JSON fields, with static-schema fallback.
- Field pinning, collapsible OpenTelemetry attribute groups, and virtualized field lists.
- Autocomplete loading and empty states, prefix-match priority, and a 50-suggestion limit with an overflow count.

### Changed

- Log drawer search moved to the properties pane, filtering by name or value.
- Updated typography, colors, spacing, and responsive layouts.
- GitHub releases include the matching changelog section.
- Updated dependencies, including Bun 1.4.2 and Better Auth 1.7.3. Migration `0021` adds nullable `session.impersonated_by`.
- Internal: migrated DOM behaviors to Svelte attachments and refactored OAuth forms and route error handling.

### Fixed

- Field discovery retries and value refresh after discovery errors.
- Duplicate field-value counts and boolean filter values.
- Duplicate row-key errors in log drawer properties.
- Chart resizing after initialization.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-09-03

### ⚠️ Breaking

- **`GET /api/indexes/{indexId}/stats` range parameters.** `from`/`to` in milliseconds are now `startTs`/`endTs` in epoch seconds.
- **`services` in `GET /api/monitoring/services` is now a list of objects** — `{ name, requests, errors, p50, p95 }`. The plain name list lives on as `serviceNames`, and `summary` gains `errorSpans`.
- **Security headers on every response**, from Hono's `secureHeaders()`: `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, COOP and CORP `same-origin`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` and `nosniff`. Embedding the UI cross-origin stops working.

### Added

- **`GET /api/monitoring/errors`** — the failing spans behind the error rate, newest first. Filters: `service`, `operation`, `kind` (`server`, `client`, `producer`, `consumer`, `internal`), `httpStatus` (`4xx`, `5xx`, `none`), `startTs`/`endTs`, `limit` (max 100) and `offset` (max 5000). Rows carry `traceId`, `spanId`, `timestampMs`, `service`, `operation`, `kind`, `message`, `httpStatus` and `durationMillis`, alongside `hasMore`. Needs `logs:read` (session cookie, personal key or service-account key) and is recorded in the search audit.
- **APM detail on `/monitoring`** — tabs for services, endpoints, dependencies and errors. Services rank by request volume with failure share and p50/p95; dependencies list each service's outbound peers with call count, total time and p50/p95; errors is a filterable span list, each row linking to its trace.
- **`failingOperations` and `dependencies` on `GET /api/monitoring/services`** — operations ranked by error count, and per-service outbound call volume and latency.
- **Monitoring state lives in the URL** — the active tab (`view`), the scoped service, and the error filters (`operation`, `kind`, `httpStatus`), so a filtered view can be linked or bookmarked.
- **Pagination on the service and endpoint tables**, with the rows-per-page choice remembered.

### Changed

- **Request IDs come from Hono's own middleware.** An inbound `x-request-id` that isn't a short, plain token is replaced with a fresh UUID instead of being echoed into the request's log lines and error body.
- **Native scrollbars everywhere.** The `overlayscrollbars` and `overlayscrollbars-svelte` dependencies are gone.
- **Bun 1.4.0** in the image, in `engines` and in `bun-types`; CI now runs `bun audit --audit-level=high`.
- **Log search and monitoring-error empty states** say what happened, announce themselves to screen readers, and offer "Clear filters" when filters explain the empty result.
- **Internal:** request logs carry the matched `route` next to `path`, database initialization moved to `lib/db`, timestamp query parameters share one validator carrying their unit, and unused Quickwit index metadata fields were dropped.

### Fixed

- Tooltips on the collapsed sidebar — nav items, **Help**, and the collapse toggle — never appeared.
- A JSON error response that isn't a Rootprint payload (a proxy 502, say) surfaced a `TypeError` instead of the real failure.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-26

### ⚠️ Breaking

- **Saved view `description` removed** from the create/patch bodies and responses of `/api/indexes/{indexId}/views`. Migration `0019` drops the column, deleting the text; 0.4.0 still selects it, so rolling back breaks every saved-view read. Read it out first if you need it: `SELECT id, index_id, name, description FROM "view" WHERE description IS NOT NULL;`

### Added

- **Service health dashboard** at `/monitoring`: request rate, error rate, latency, per-service p95, and endpoints ranked by total time.
- **`GET /api/monitoring/services`** — `startTs`, `endTs`, `interval`, optional `service` and `endpointLimit`; max 30-day range and 2000 buckets. Needs `logs:read` (session cookie or personal key) and is recorded in the search audit.
- **`timeRange` on saved views** — a relative preset (`5m`–`30d`) or an absolute epoch-second window, opt-in when saving. Views saved without one leave the current range alone.
- **`SEARCH_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS`** prunes search audit rows on the hourly stats tick. Default and minimum 30 days; lower values fail at boot.
- **`omittedCount` on histogram buckets** — how many documents the bucket's returned level terms left out. The web derives an `UNKNOWN` level from it for documents with no level field; being synthetic, it cannot be filtered on.

### Changed

- **GitHub org membership** is read from one paginated `GET /user/memberships/orgs` (≤10 pages of 100) and matched case-insensitively, instead of one probe per configured org. 5s timeout, redirects refused, failures logged with GitHub's rate-limit headers. Failure still denies access; an error raised during the check now denies the sign-in instead of failing the request.
- **Durations over a minute** format as minutes, hours, or days.
- **README** leads with the live demo at [demo.rootprint.io](https://demo.rootprint.io).
- **Internal (web):** the root layout no longer re-fetches session and bootstrap state on client-side navigation, endpoint row-count buttons filter locally, modal busy state and the field row and time-range picker were centralized, and the Geist fonts are preloaded.

### Fixed

- Switching indexes clears the views dropdown instead of leaving the previous index's views on screen.
- Saving a view no longer stores an empty column set before display preferences resolve.
- The log detail drawer dropped `aria-modal`; it never trapped focus or blocked the page.
- Page titles and breadcrumbs for the index edit and GitHub authentication pages.
- A field table's last row no longer draws a border against the container's own.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-12

### ⚠️ Breaking

- **Per-index visibility is gone.** Any index previously set to `admin` or `hidden` becomes readable by every signed-in user and every `logs:read` personal API key once the migration runs. The `visibility` field is gone from `PATCH /api/indexes/:indexId`, the `?view=` query parameter is gone from `GET /api/indexes`, and `visibility` is gone from every per-index row in `GET /api/admin/cluster`.

  **Action required before upgrading.** Migration `0017` drops the column, so once it has run there is no record of which indexes were restricted. Inventory them first:

  ```sql
  SELECT index_id, visibility FROM index_settings WHERE visibility <> 'all';
  ```

  The migration is forward-only and runs automatically at boot. Rolling the image back to 0.3.6 afterwards leaves that version selecting a column that no longer exists, which fails every index read — recovery needs a database restore.

- **`GET /api/indexes` returns a smaller row.** `fieldCount`, `sourceCount`, `mode`, and `createTimestamp` are no longer included. `mode` moved to `GET /api/indexes/:indexId`, where `fieldCount` and `sourceCount` can be derived from `fields` and `sources`; note that endpoint is admin-only and cookie-authenticated, so it is not a substitute for callers using a personal API key. `createTimestamp` is removed with no replacement.

- **`role` is gone from ingest keys.** The field no longer appears on the rows returned by `GET /api/api-keys`. It had been pinned to the single value `"ingest"` ever since 0.3.5 removed the search role, so nothing could branch on it; migration `0018` drops the column along with its index and check constraint. Like `0017` it is forward-only, and 0.3.6 selects the column it removes — rolling back after it runs breaks every API-key read.

- **Quickwit metrics fields renamed and dropped in `GET /api/admin/metrics`.** `uptimeSeconds` is gone from the top level, `fdsOpen` and `fdsMax` are gone from `resources`, and `memoryRssBytes` is now `memoryResidentBytes`. Quickwit 0.9 stopped exporting the metrics behind the removed fields, so they had already been reporting `null`; they were marked deprecated before being dropped. The `build` block (`version`, `commitHash`, `buildDate`) is now read from the same metrics scrape rather than a separate version probe.

### Added

- **Traces.** Ingest OTLP spans with `POST /v1/traces` using any existing ingest key, and open a trace from the log that belongs to it — the log detail drawer gains a **Trace** tab with an inline waterfall, and a full trace page at `/traces/:traceId` shows the waterfall with per-span attributes, events, and links back to correlated logs. Pasting a trace ID into the log search box opens that trace directly. Spans are stored in one configured index (`TRACE_INDEX_ID`, defaulting to `otel-traces-v0_9`).

  Trace detail is a raw `trace_id` search with no time bound, so a trace stays openable for as long as its spans are retained — Quickwit's Jaeger API, which this does not use, ignored the requested window and looked back a fixed 72 hours. The response carries `truncated`, and the view says so when a trace is larger than one request returns. Duplicate span documents that OTLP retries produce are collapsed by `span_id`. In the attributes panel `otel.status_code` and `error` are dropped as restatements of the span's own error state, while `span.kind` and `otel.status_description` are kept.

  There is no span search or trace list in this release: traces are reached from a log or by trace ID.

- **Per-index "Trace ID field" setting.** `traceIdField` on `PATCH /api/indexes/:indexId` and in the index config form names the path to a trace ID inside a log document. It is what links logs to traces in both directions, and it defaults to `trace_id`.

- **Trace setup in the send-telemetry wizard.** **Settings → Send logs** is now **Settings → Send logs & traces**, and its route moved from `/settings/send-logs` to `/settings/send-telemetry`. Each integration has a traces variant (`?signal=traces`) alongside its logs snippets. Keys anchored to the span store are hidden from the wizard's key picker, since they cannot ship logs.

- **Cluster identity and node counts in admin health.** The `health` block of `GET /api/admin/cluster` adds `clusterId`, `readyNodes`, `liveNodes`, and `deadNodes`, each nullable when the upstream does not report it.

- **`isTraceIndex` on index rows.** Both `GET /api/indexes` and `GET /api/indexes/:indexId` flag the index that holds spans, so clients can tell it apart without knowing the value of `TRACE_INDEX_ID`.

- **`information` recognized as a severity level.** It sorts next to `info` in the level facet and gets its own color, alongside the existing `warning`/`critical` aliases.

- **Sourcemaps in production API builds,** so stack traces from the bundled `dist/app.js` map back to source.

### Changed

- **Ingest keys can no longer be created against the span store.** `POST /api/api-keys` returns `400 INDEX_IS_TRACE_INDEX` for an index equal to `TRACE_INDEX_ID`, since a key anchored there would write log documents into the span index. An existing key anchored there keeps working for `POST /v1/traces`, but its log ingestion (`POST /v1/logs`, `POST /api/ingest`) is now rejected with the same error.
- **`POST /v1/logs` now reports partial failures.** It forwards Quickwit's `partial_success.rejected_log_records` instead of always returning an empty success body, and upstream 4xx statuses pass through rather than collapsing to `400`. OTLP exporters that were receiving silent successes will start seeing rejections they were previously blind to.
- **Filter values containing `<`, `>` or `=` are now quoted when composed into a query.** Saved views and shares whose filter values contain those characters produce a slightly different Quickwit query than before; results should be the same or more accurate, since previously those characters were passed through as query operators.
- **New ingest keys carry an `rp_` prefix** instead of `lwit_`. The prefix is only applied when a key is minted and is not part of how a key is looked up, so keys issued by earlier versions keep working unchanged.
- **Unmatched `/api/*` paths return a JSON 404** instead of falling through to the SPA's HTML shell. A typo in a client's path now surfaces as a parseable error rather than a page of markup.
- **The empty-state onboarding screen is driven by a live document check.** `GET /api/admin/cluster/document-status` asks Quickwit directly instead of reading the periodic snapshot, so a fresh cluster leaves the getting-started screen as soon as the first document lands rather than at the next snapshot. The span store is excluded from the check — spans alone do not count as having logs.
- **Menus and dropdowns use the browser's native popover API,** which replaces the hand-rolled open/close and outside-click handling.
- **New logo mark** across the app and its favicon.
- **Internal (api):** the index middlewares were consolidated into one implementation, log-scope and API-key parameter schemas were centralized, request logs now record the final response status, API-key `lastUsedAt` writes are throttled in SQL, and export batching and search totals were separated from result queries.
- **Internal (web):** shared search and time-range controls, modal form handling, and form/confirmation error handling were centralized; the charts share one `UplotChart` component; and hand-written response casts gave way to the Hono RPC client's inferred types.
- **Dependency updates,** including quickwit-js 0.4, Vite 8, `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` 7, Hono, and Better Auth 1.6.25.

### Fixed

- **Log list and search toolbar interaction edge cases,** including stale field keys in the field-mappings editor, a modal that ignored cancellation, and JSON pane rendering in the log drawer.
- **Popovers no longer stay visible when closed** in cases where a display utility class fought the native `[popover]` state.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- **Query autocomplete.** The search bar suggests field names and completions as you type, with refined field-completion details and a subtle highlight for the active suggestion.
- **Empty-state onboarding.** A fresh cluster with no documents yet shows a getting-started screen instead of a blank search, pointing admins toward **Settings → Send logs**.
- **Richer log context drawer.** A new context tab lets you pick which fields make up a log's context, with per-field scope toggles and a set of default context fields. Context rows open their log in place, and a dedicated traceback tab surfaces stack traces.
- **API rate limiting.** The API now rate-limits requests to protect the backend.
- **Structured API request logging.** Requests are logged in a structured format for easier searching and diagnostics.
- **Dynamic field mapping.** Indexes support dynamic mapping, alongside a simpler web UI for it.
- **Documentation links in Send logs.** The Send logs integrations link out to their setup docs.
- **Dependabot.** Dependency updates are now proposed automatically.

### Changed

- **Timestamps drop the timezone mode.** Web timestamps render in a single, consistent scheme.
- **Message fields and column settings backfilled** with sensible defaults; empty inline log parts are filtered out.
- **Internal (api):** API schemas and services were refactored, and the ingest-source logic was split out of the index service into its own service with a shared field-name schema.
- **Dependency updates,** including bun 1.3.14, TypeScript 6, and several GitHub Actions.

### Fixed

- **Frequency chart tooltip** no longer reads out of bounds at the chart edges.
- **Log drawer rows** use stable rendering keys, fixing list update glitches.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **Index creation and editing from the admin UI.** Admins create and edit indexes under **Settings → Indexes** without touching Quickwit. A guided form covers the index ID, document mapping (through a new field-mappings editor), search settings, and retention, backed by new index create/update API routes.
- **Personal API keys.** Each user mints their own search keys under **Account → API keys**, and the secret shows once on creation. These keys replace the old shared search-role tokens (see _⚠️ Breaking_).
- **Service accounts.** Admins create non-human service accounts under **Security → Service accounts** and issue API keys scoped to them, which keeps automation separate from real user accounts. The UI documents API-key roles and their use.
- **Kafka ingest source.** Index ingest sources now support **Kafka** alongside Kinesis and file (SQS/S3-notification), configured from the source forms.
- **OpenTelemetry Collector and Kubernetes send-logs integrations.** **Settings → Send logs** gains two integrations, plus an origin search to find one as the catalog grows.
- **Filters saved with views and shares.** Saved views keep the full result setup: query, filters, sort direction, and column layout. Shared links carry their filters too, so a recipient opens the same filtered result (migrations `0012`, `0014`).
- **Admin-aware index listings.** Index views account for admin scope, so admins see every index.

### ⚠️ Breaking

- **Existing search API keys stop working.** We removed the shared "search" API-key role. Read access now comes only from **personal API keys** (one per user) or **service account** keys (for automation). Migration `0013` deletes every search-role key and drops its `token` audit history. **Action required:** before you upgrade, reissue credentials. Have each user create a personal key under **Account → API keys**, or create a service account under **Security → Service accounts** and issue it a key, then point every log shipper, script, and integration that read with an old search key at the new one. Ingest keys keep working.

### Changed

- **Saved queries became saved views.** Views store the full result setup (query, filters, sort, columns) under one API and a new `ViewsDropdown`. The migration carries existing saved queries over.
- **File ingest source labelled "SQS."** The UI and API call file-notification sources SQS throughout.
- **Web app reorganized into feature folders,** and the OAuth provider setup forms collapse into one shared form.
- **Internal (api):** we split error translation/logging, index-metadata access middleware, and request/response schemas into dedicated modules, and expanded OpenAPI output and field-values metadata.
- **UI polish.** Tidied the API-key dropdown layout, sidebar row borders, and collapsed sidebar groups. A mobile gate points small-screen users to a desktop browser.

### Fixed

- **Clipboard copy inside modal dialogs.** Copy buttons, such as the one-time key reveal, now work inside a modal.
- **Log viewer hardened against invalid data.** Malformed log entries no longer break rendering.
- **API security and admin error handling hardened** across ingest, index access, sharing, and several admin forms.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- **GitHub OAuth sign-in.** GitHub joins Google as a configurable authentication provider, managed from **Security → Authentication**. Admins enter a GitHub OAuth app's client ID and secret and can restrict sign-in to members of one or more allowed GitHub organizations (org membership is checked against the GitHub API at login). A dedicated provider page handles setup, and a confirmation modal handles removal.
- **Quickwit ingest source management.** Indexes can now have their ingest sources created and edited from the admin UI (**Settings → Indexes → _index_ → Sources**). Both **Kinesis** and **file** (SQS/S3-notification) source types are supported, with per-source controls for input format (JSON, plain text, and the OTLP logs/traces JSON and protobuf variants), pipeline count, and an optional VRL transform script. A source summary view surfaces the current configuration at a glance.
- **Build information in API responses.** Quickwit build/version details are now included in the relevant admin API responses and shown on the admin overview's cluster identity strip.

### Changed

- **Cluster connection-state handling reworked.** The `ClusterIdentityStrip` and admin overview were updated to handle and present the Quickwit connection state more clearly.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- **Compressed NDJSON ingest.** The NDJSON ingest route now forwards the incoming `content-encoding` header to Quickwit, so gzip-compressed NDJSON bodies are ingested correctly instead of being mis-parsed.

### Changed

- **Node.js log-shipping examples modernized.** The Node.js OpenTelemetry and Winston "send logs" snippets now attach a detected resource (picking up `service.name` and `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` from the environment via `@opentelemetry/resources`), use the current `LoggerProvider({ resource, processors })` constructor form, and shut the provider down cleanly on exit.
- **Internal (web):** query and UI helpers consolidated (#24). Admin-overview metrics polling was extracted into a dedicated `MetricsPoller` class; a shared `windowToSpanMs` helper replaces the duplicated window-to-milliseconds maps; admin API calls now surface server error messages through `readApiError`; and shared `isPlainObject` / `setSearchParam` / `copyWithToast` helpers were introduced. `composeQuery` now returns `*` (match-all) for empty input directly, so callers no longer carry a `|| '*'` fallback. Dead helpers (`formatLatencyMs`, `formatRatePerSecond`, `timeRangeDurationMs`, and the `cn` class-merge util) were removed.

### Removed

- **Unused shadcn-svelte scaffolding (web).** Removed `components.json`, the `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `tailwind-variants`, and `tw-animate-css` dependencies, and their leftover CSS (the `tw-animate-css` import plus the `@custom-variant dark` and unused `@theme inline` color aliases).

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- **Profile settings page.** A new **Account → Profile** section lets every user view their identity (name, email, ID) and change the password they sign in with, via a dedicated change-password modal. The password controls are hidden for users who only sign in through Google.
- **Admin user profile page.** Administrators can open an individual user from **Security → Users** to see their full profile details on a dedicated page.
- **Role filter tabs on the API keys page.** The API keys list can now be filtered by role with a tab strip.
- **OpenAPI documentation for the API.** The Hono API now generates an `openapi.json` spec at build time (`bun run openapi:generate`) using `hono-openapi` and `@valibot/to-json-schema`. Route descriptions, standardized response schemas, and consistent error shapes were added across the API, and the Better Auth routes are folded into the same spec.

### Changed

- **Export dialog and log-row polish.** The export dialog styling was refined, and log rows now tint their hover state with the entry's level color.
- **Admin role badges** restyled to a neutral appearance.
- **Profile settings layout widened** for more comfortable reading.
- **Activity view reworked.** The admin activity screen was rebuilt around a new `ActivityPanel`, replacing the previous `ActivityTable`.

### Removed

- **Slowest-query activity views.** The "slowest queries" panels and their backing `search-activity` service were removed, along with the standalone per-user activity detail page (user details now live on the admin user profile page).

### Fixed

- **Container crashed on startup** (`ENOENT: open '/package.json'`). The OpenAPI spec reads the workspace-root `package.json` for its version, but that file was not present in the runtime image. The Docker image now ships it so the API boots. _(Re-released; the initial 0.3.2 image was affected.)_

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- **Display mode and line-wrap preferences.** Two new per-user display settings: a **table / inline** display mode for results and a **line-wrap** toggle for log rows, persisted in `user_preference` (migration `0011`). The former **Column settings** panel is now **Display settings**.
- **Hidden index support.** Indexes can be marked hidden, with a new `require-manageable-index` middleware gating index management and access accordingly.
- **Embedded JSON resolution in the log detail drawer.** String field values whose content is itself a JSON object or array are now parsed into real nested JSON (recursively, depth-capped) before the JSON tab pretty-prints them. Scalar-looking strings are left untouched so they are not coerced to other types.

### Changed

- **Drawer search highlighting now uses the CSS Custom Highlight API** instead of wrapping matches in DOM nodes. The `HighlightedText` component was replaced by `dom-highlight.ts`.
- **Charts migrated from LayerChart to uPlot.** The latency, volume, and storage-trend charts were reimplemented on uPlot, and the bespoke `ui/chart/*` wrapper components were removed.
- **Admin users list layout refined**, alongside updated send-logs integration examples and documentation.
- **Internal (API):** all backend constants consolidated into a single `constants.ts`; search and export parameters refactored, with shared types expanded in `types.ts`.
- **Internal (web):** dependency-invalidation keys reworked (`api/deps.ts`, new `request-guard` store) with consolidated error handling across loaders and components.

### Upgrade notes

1. Migration `0011` applies on startup. It adds `line_wrap` and `display_mode` columns to `user_preference`, both with defaults — no manual action required.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-31

Complete architectural rewrite. Rootprint is now a Bun-workspace monorepo: a standalone **Hono API** (`apps/api`) and a separate **SvelteKit SPA** (`apps/web`) that talks to it over HTTP. The previous single SvelteKit-server deployment is gone, and the datastore has moved from SQLite to **PostgreSQL**.

### ⚠️ Breaking changes

- **New two-process architecture.** The monolith is split into an API server (`apps/api`) and a static web client (`apps/web`). You now deploy and run the API as its own service; the web app is served as static assets.
- **PostgreSQL replaces SQLite.** Persistence moved from `sqlite.db` to PostgreSQL (Drizzle + `pg`). There is no in-place migration from the old SQLite database — this is a fresh schema. Provision a Postgres instance and run `bun run db:migrate` against it before starting the API.
- **Configuration changes.** The API requires a Postgres connection and a resolvable `ORIGIN`. Review `.env.example` and update your deployment.

### Upgrade notes

Because the storage engine changed, **0.3.0 is not an in-place upgrade from 0.2.x.** Stand up a new deployment:

1. Provision PostgreSQL and set the connection string (see `.env.example`).
2. Deploy `apps/api` as a service and run `bun run db:migrate`.
3. Build and serve `apps/web` (static) pointed at the API's `ORIGIN`.
4. Recreate ingest tokens and re-add users; data is not carried over from the SQLite database.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Index stats strip expanded to four cards.** The header on the index detail page now shows **Last ingest**, **Ingestion · 24h**, **Index size**, and **Growth · 7d avg**. The 24-hour and 7-day cards are computed from a new background snapshot job (`index-stats-snapshot.ts`) that captures Quickwit's `describeIndex` output every 5 minutes and prunes rows older than 35 days. New deployments display `—` / `collecting data` until enough history is available.
- **Trace ID button in the log detail drawer.** Click the trace ID in an expanded log entry to copy it to the clipboard, with a paired clipboard-failure announcement for assistive tech.
- **Repository hygiene.** GitHub issue templates (bug report, feature request) and a pull request template, plus `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `SECURITY.md`.

### Changed

- **Field-mapping defaults are now universal.** Previously, only indexes with IDs starting with `otel-logs-` received OpenTelemetry-friendly defaults (`severity_text` / `body.message` / `attributes.exception.stacktrace`); other indexes fell back to `level` / `message` / empty. Every index now uses the OTel-friendly defaults until you save explicit settings in **Administration → Indexes → Configuration**. Existing indexes with saved settings are unaffected.
- **Password-reset gating moved from Google-presence to credential-presence.** **Reset password** and self-serve password change are now disabled when a user has no credential account (i.e. has only ever signed in via Google). Users who have both a Google and a credential account can now reset their password normally — previously the linked Google account blocked the action. A new `user.has_credential_account` column tracks this.
- **Log detail drawer rework.** Refactored layout, value-cell styling, and copy interactions for better readability and accessibility.
- **Internal:** `indexes_meta` table renamed to `index_settings`; ingest gateway and OTLP route extracted bearer parsing into `$lib/server/utils/bearer.ts`; Quickwit client and several services moved from a factory to a singleton import.

### Fixed

- **Inflated 24-hour ingestion metrics.** The previous calendar-aligned histogram could over-report the 24-hour count when snapshot history had gaps. The redesigned card uses snapshot deltas with a tight ±1h anchor window so missing history yields `—` rather than a misleading multi-day total.
- **Removed a `console.log` that leaked user IDs** during the Google account-linking flow.

### Removed

- Unused `IndexPicker.svelte` component.

### Upgrade notes

1. Back up `sqlite.db` before running migrations.
2. Migrations `0031`–`0033` will apply on startup. They rename `indexes_meta` → `index_settings` and add `user.has_credential_account` (back-filled from existing `account` rows).
3. If your index visibility/field configuration was relying on the previous `level` / `message` defaults for non-OTel indexes, save explicit settings on those indexes from **Administration → Indexes → Configuration** before upgrading.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- **OTLP endpoint is protobuf-only.** `/api/otlp/v1/logs` now returns `415` for `Content-Type: application/json` (previously the request was forwarded and Quickwit returned an opaque `400`). Users of `@opentelemetry/exporter-logs-otlp-http` (which defaults to JSON) should switch to `@opentelemetry/exporter-logs-otlp-proto`. JavaScript integration guides (docs and admin UI) have been updated to use `@opentelemetry/exporter-logs-otlp-proto`.

### Fixed

- **Docker log-shipping guide (docs and `/administration/send-logs/docker`).** The previous OpenTelemetry Collector config relied on the `container` operator emitting `container.name`, but the `docker` format only emits `log.iostream` and the parsed timestamp — so the `filter/exclude_self` processor never matched and the self-exclusion loop guard was a no-op. The config now derives `container.id` from the log file path with a `transform` processor and matches the filter against `${env:HOSTNAME}` (Docker's default short container ID) instead. `service.name` falls back to the container ID when an app hasn't set one itself.
- **Docker log-shipping guide — permission denied.** Added `user: "0:0"` to the collector compose service. The `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib` image runs as UID 10001 by default, which cannot read `/var/lib/docker/containers`.
- **Docker log-shipping guide — noisy parser errors.** Added `on_error: send_quiet` to the `container` operator. The operator's k8s-metadata step runs a regex that matches only pod log paths and fails loudly on Docker paths; entries are still forwarded, but the error logs are now suppressed.
- **Docker log-shipping guide — dropped an unneeded Docker socket mount.** `/var/run/docker.sock` was mounted in the compose snippet but never actually read by the `container` operator.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-20

Major release reshaping the administration experience, adding first-class log-ingestion guides, and introducing marketing + documentation sites.

### ⚠️ Breaking changes

- **Ingest tokens are wiped on upgrade.** Migration `0030_rework_ingest_token.sql` rebuilds the `ingest_token` table: tokens are now stored in plaintext (so they can be re-shown in the UI) and each token is scoped to exactly one index. Previous hashed tokens cannot be recovered, so **all existing rows are deleted** — recreate any tokens after upgrading.
- **Default HTTP port changed to `8282`.** Update reverse proxies, firewall rules, and any compose overrides that relied on the previous default.
- **Admin routes moved.** `/administration` is now a section with its own sidebar — `/administration/users`, `/administration/tokens`, `/administration/indexes`, `/administration/authentication`, `/administration/send-logs`. Deep links into the previous single-page layout need updating.
- **Auth flow change.** First-run `/auth/change-password` is replaced by `/auth/setup-admin`.

### Added

- **Administration**
  - New admin layout with sidebar navigation and breadcrumbs
  - Per-user role management from the users table
  - Member actions menu for user moderation
  - Dedicated Authentication section with Google provider form
  - Index management UI: delete index, manage sources, view/edit config, per-index stats
  - Ingest token management UI: create, view (plaintext), delete; tokens scoped to a single index
- **Send Logs**
  - New `/administration/send-logs` section with copy-pasteable integration guides for Python, Go, Java, JavaScript, .NET, Docker, and plain HTTP
  - OTLP HTTP endpoint at `/api/otlp/v1/logs` for OpenTelemetry exporters
- **Indexes**
  - Index detail page rework with tabs: Overview, Fields, Sources, Configuration
  - Index stats row highlights ingestion drops
  - Searchable index list
- **Sites**
  - Marketing site under `site/` (deploys to GitHub Pages)
  - Mintlify docs site under `docs-site/` covering install, configuration, index management, and send-logs guides

### Changed

- Service layer split: new `index-stats.service.ts` and `quickwit-index.service.ts`
- Reusable UI primitives: `Modal`, `ConfirmModal`, `Callout`, `CodeBlock`, `InlineCode`
- Constants reorganised under `src/lib/constants/`
- Config loading and validation refactored
- Ingest token revocation is now deletion
- Config tab renamed to "Index Configuration"

### Fixed

- Admins no longer hit an error when accessing a non-existent index
- Clearer error messages across admin flows
- `LogContextView` no longer retains unused state

### Removed

- Unit and integration test suite removed — the project no longer maintains tests
- Accent colour from checkboxes

### Upgrade notes

1. Back up `sqlite.db` before running migrations.
2. Run `bun run db:migrate` — migrations `0025`–`0030` will apply.
3. Recreate any ingest tokens through **Administration → Tokens** and update your log shippers.
4. If you override the HTTP port, confirm your compose/proxy configuration still works with the new `8282` default.
5. Point OpenTelemetry exporters at `/api/otlp/v1/logs` if you want OTLP ingestion.
